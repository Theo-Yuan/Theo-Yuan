### 💡 About Me

I'm a backend engineer with **production-level experience building scalable systems** using **Rust**, **Tokio**, and **Axum**.  
I also hold a **Master’s degree in Computer Science**, with research focused on **video anomaly detection** and **image classification** using deep learning.

My recent work includes:

- Refactoring high-concurrency chat services at **Zoom** using Rust  
- Designing async architectures with **OpenTelemetry-based observability**  
- Building **L7 gateways** and **real-time data streaming proxies**  
- Developing deep learning models for **urban surveillance** and **disaster detection**

I'm passionate about **performance**, **clean async code**, and building **reliable systems** that scale.
